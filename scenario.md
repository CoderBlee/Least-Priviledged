# Scenario

## Background
In a corporate setting, an IT administrator is tasked with implementing the principle of least privilege on a Windows operating system to enhance security.

## Steps

1. **Creating Users**: Users Bee1 and Bee2 are created with standard access.
2. **Folder Creation**: A shared folder is created for storing sensitive documents.
3. **Permission Assignment**: Bee1 is given read-only access, while Bee2 has read-write access.
4. **Testing**: The setup is tested to ensure it meets security requirements.

## Outcome

The implementation was successful. Testing verified that Bee1 had read-only access while Bee2 could both read and write to the shared folder.
